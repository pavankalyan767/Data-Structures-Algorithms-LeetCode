848. Shifting Letters
Solved

You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and an integer array shifts of the same length.

Call the shift() of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a').

For example, shift('a') = 'b', shift('t') = 'u', and shift('z') = 'a'.
Now for each shifts[i] = x, we want to shift the first i + 1 letters of s, x times.

Return the final string after all such shifts to s are applied.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
Output: "rpl"
Explanation: We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters of s by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters of s by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters of s by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaa", shifts = [1,2,3]
Output: "gfd"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
shifts.length == s.length
0 <= shifts[i] <= 109

Approach
1. properly read the question and understand it 
2. so take a suffix array so that i can get how many times each index should be incremented 
3. reverse the suffix array 
4. make sure you use %26 so that it doens't go more than that ie 26 letters in alphabets
5. use a res array to record the ordinal of the letter after incrementing it by the number in suffix array 
6. after that if the any number is greater than 122 then take modulus and add 96 to it 
7. then convert this ordinal to characters in every index for the string and add it to the result and return it

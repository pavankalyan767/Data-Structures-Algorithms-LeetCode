Hint
You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a 2D array of integers queries.

Each query queries[i] = [li, ri] asks us to find the number of strings present in the range li to ri (both inclusive) of words that start and end with a vowel.

Return an array ans of size queries.length, where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.

Note that the vowel letters are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["aba","bcb","ece","aa","e"], queries = [[0,2],[1,4],[1,1]]
Output: [2,3,0]
Explanation: The strings starting and ending with a vowel are "aba", "ece", "aa" and "e".
The answer to the query [0,2] is 2 (strings "aba" and "ece").
to query [1,4] is 3 (strings "ece", "aa", "e").
to query [1,1] is 0.
We return [2,3,0].
Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","e","i"], queries = [[0,2],[0,1],[2,2]]
Output: [3,2,1]
Explanation: Every string satisfies the conditions, so we return [3,2,1].
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 105
1 <= words[i].length <= 40
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
sum(words[i].length) <= 3 * 105
1 <= queries.length <= 105
0 <= li <= ri < words.length

Approach 

1. so calculate a prefix array , which consista of the count of the desired words(words which start with a vowel and end with a vowel)
2. iterate over the queries array , and if l>0 then subtract the count of desired words in prefix array till that r 
3. with the number of such words before l ie prefix[r]-prefix[l-1]
4. if the query starts at l=0 then no need to do that and directly append the count from prefix to the final array

            prefix.append(count)
        final = []

        for l,r in queries:
            if l>0:

                final.append(prefix[r]-prefix[l-1])
